So yeah, it is somewhat stupid, but I just want to try it.

goals / features / ...
- ANSI tests ([[https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/ansi-test/ansi-test][here]]).
- Running on a vm? Or maybe not?
  - But WebAssembly would be cool.
- Threads
  - And maybe green threads too / instead
- ASDF / UIOP / CFFI / BORDEAUX-THREADS / ATOMICS / CLOSER-MOP
  - Well, [[http://portability.cl/][portability layers]].
    - PLN, symbol-links
- Tree shaker?
- Different / good GC's?

What do I do? I don't know.
