Host:
  - Simplified external package system  [ + initial layout ]
  - Compiler [ CL ]     ^ should use that
    Needs to know:
    - how to generate bytecode
    - how to store simple objects:
      - number
      - cons, vector/array, string [ ascii string ], hashtable/hashset
    - Also deal with macros [ must be grcl's macros ]
  - Reader
    - look up symbols in simplified packages,
    - grcl's backquote
  --> read grcl's code in, compile to bytecode, save as a core
      including:
      - compiler
      - reader
      - internal package system
      - CLOS
      - conditions
      - printer
      - environments...
      - lib
        - streams
        - conses & lists
        - strings, chars & unicode
        - sequences
        - macros
        - files, filenames
